The following is a python script utilizing the opencv, mediapipe and pyautogui module. The program reads a video input from the system's default videocam and uses the mediapipe module to detect hands and recognize the 21 importants hand points. Then it maps the middle of the hand and defines a boundary. Inside boundary, there will be no keyboard input and moving the hand will simulate the keyboard key corresponding to the motion.
